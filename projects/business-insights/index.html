      <h3>1. Revenue Trends</h3>
      <p>
        Revenue spikes strongly in November–December (holiday sales), then dips in January. This
        suggests the business is highly seasonal.
      </p>
      <details class="step-brief">
        <summary>Direction</summary>
        <p>
          Highlight this seasonality in dashboards. Recommend inventory ramp-ups & campaign
          spending increases in Q4, and possibly retention-focused campaigns in January to soften
          the post-holiday dip.
